## Sticky Form Planning (Milestone 2)

### Sticky Form (Milestone 2)
> What controls do you need for your form?
Name, email, year, top three favorite podcasts (separated by commas), episode pitch

> Plan out your feedback messages for your form. You may sketch (probably the easiest) or write it out.
Please
!(Contact Sticky Form)[sticky-form.PNG]

> How does this form meet the needs of at least one of your target audiences (specify which)?
This form meets the needs of the first target audience, which are potential students interested in learning how to produce podcasts and join the production team. The form will serve as a source of contact for them and also begin the process of developing a unique idea with the help of the production team.

### Validation Code Plan (Milestone 2)
> Write out your pseudocode plan for handling the validation of the form.

```
WRITE YOUR PSEUDOCODE HERE

if name field is empty, form is not valid and name feedback is set to True

if email field is not valid email address, form is set to invalid and email feedback set to TRUE

if none of radio buttons for team interest is selected, form is set to invalid and class year feedback set to TRUE
```

## Complete & Polished Website (Final Submission)

### Target Audiences (Final Submission)
> Tell us how your final site meets the needs of the target audiences. Be specific here. Tell us how you tailored your design, content, etc. to make your website usable by both target audiences.
The drop down menu for the first question after the identification questions was about purpose for contacting team. This helps the team distinguish the two primary target audiences apart from each other, and also more importantly allows the audience to recognize that their purpose for contacting the team is recognized and accounted for. An additional not applicable area for the question regarding interest on team allows for the second target audience to indicate their interests are separate from the first target audience. In addition, not making the final question of the episode pitch required demonstrates that it is more aligned with the needs of one audience, and recognizes that the connection form is meant to serve two different audiences.

### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. You don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey.


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from 1300? What things did you have trouble with?

I learned of a much easier way to test whether any of the radio buttons have been selected, as well as the purpose behind each component of a form control. This was building off of my prior 1300 knowledge, but greater opportunities to complete more challenging tasks helped me explore new concepts I previosuly was rusty on. In addition, I felt that my grasp of stylistic aspects of web design has also improved, because I have greater understanding of the different options at my disposal for formatting. When I'm de-bugging the code, I also have noticed a better intuition for sources of potential error, which has helped me catch the issues faster.
